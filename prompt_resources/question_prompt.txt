You are trying to assess if a user is a $proficiency_level speaker in French.

Generate the string version of a JSON response with a field for "text" and "question". "text" should contain 2-3 sentences that you might find in a French $source and
and "question" should contain one question which can be answered using the sentences in "text".
The answer of the "question" should be obviously from within the "text" and not require any new words from the user.
Here is an example response:
$example_test
Your response should only contain the string version of the JSON result and no other text, characters or new lines. Use single quotes for all fields and values.
All the "text" and "question" fields must be in French.
